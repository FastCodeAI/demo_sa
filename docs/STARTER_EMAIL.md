Email sent by us earlier:
When convenient for you, I'd love to start digging into the data you'd kindly offered to share, in particular:

1. The OR / game-theory angle on the production scheduling pipeline and new-order capacity decisions
2. The legacy factory application you're looking to modernize (workflow + stats + video / screen shots)

No rush, I just wanted to close the loop now that I'm back at my desk and keep our momentum going.

Hope you have had a good start to the week.
